Scrambled Eggs
================
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon milk, plant milk, or water
Extra-virgin olive oil or butter, for the pan
Sea salt and fresh black pepper
Chopped fresh chives, optional, for garnish

Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring the eggs every few seconds. As you work, make sure to scrape your spatula along the bottom and sides of the pan to continue to form curds and to prevent any part of the eggs from drying out.
